Amber input files:
min.mdin: Minimization.
heat.mdin: Temperature equilibration.
equil.mdin: Temperature and pressure equilibration.
md_pH_templeate.mdin: Constant pH molecular dynamics.

Bash files:
Flow.sh: Flow chart showing the individual steps to prepare input and run minimization and equilbiration on CPUs. (read but do not run the script)
min.sh: Runs minimization using `min.mdin` input on GPUs.
heat.sh: Runs temperature equilibration using `heat.mdin` input on GPUs.
equil.sh: Runs temperature and pressure equilbiration using `equil.mdin` input on GPUs.
Prepare_Production.sh: Creates a submit script for SLURM queue systems and prepares the indivial replica.
Titration_Analysis.sh: Script to extract degree of deprotonation on a residual resolution. Running average and cummlative averages are also extracted.
Prepare_MicroMacroData.sh: Script to extract conditional probabilities of protonation used for Bjerrum diagram.
